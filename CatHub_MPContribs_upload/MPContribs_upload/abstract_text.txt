Materials science is primarily concerned with the underlying relationship between a material's structure and functionality,
where the knowledge of viable polymorphic forms of crystals plays an indispensable role.
Machine-learning based surrogate models have the potential to accelerate this process of creating the knowledge-base for materials polymorphs for target applications in under-explored chemistries.
Herein, we report on a readily generalizable active-learning (AL) accelerated algorithm for the targeted identification of novel and stable IrOx (x=2 or 3) polymorphs and subsequent thermochemical analyses of the activity of these discovered structures towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
We demonstrate that compared to a random search,
the AL framework more than doubles the efficiency of using DFT to find stable polymorphs out of a large array of prototypical structures.
We find nearly 195 IrO2 polymorphs within the thermodynamic synthesizability limit and reaffirm the rutile ground state.
For IrO3, we find 74 unique synthesizable polymorphs and report a previously unknown FeF3-like ground state.
The algorithm is exceptionally adept at quickly picking out the most stable polymorphs, with the most stable α-IrO3 phase discovered on average in only 4.3 generations.
An analysis of the structural properties of these metastable polymorphs reveals that octahedral local coordination environments are preferred for all low energy structures.
Subsequent Pourbaix and thermochemical analyses with this α-IrO3 phase show that it is fully stable under acidic OER conditions,
and delivers lower theoretical overpotentials compared to R-IrO2 due to weaker and more ideal binding of the OER intermediates on its oxidized surfaces.
