The discovery of high-performing and stable materials for sustainable energy applications is a pressing goal in catalysis and materials science.
Herein, we report a readily generalizable active-learning (AL) accelerated algorithm for identification of electrochemically stable iridium-oxide polymorphs of IrO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>3</sub>.
Structural candidates are generated by identifying all 956 structurally unique AB<sub>2</sub> and AB<sub>3</sub> prototypes in existing materials databases (more than 38000).
Next, using an active learning approach we are able to find 196 IrO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs within the thermodynamic amorphous synthesizability limit and reaffirm the global stability of the rutile structure.
We find 75 synthesizable IrO<sub>3</sub> polymorphs and report a previously unknown FeF<sub>3</sub>-type structure as the most stable, termed α-IrO<sub>3</sub>.
To test the algorithms performance, we compare to a random search of the candidate space and report at least a twofold increase in the rate of discovery.
Additionally, the AL approach can acquire the most stable polymorphs of IrO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>3</sub> with less than 30 density functional theory optimizations.
Subsequent Pourbaix Ir-H<sub>2</sub>O analysis shows that α-IrO<sub>3</sub> is the globally stable solid phase under acidic OER conditions and supersedes the stability of rutile IrO<sub>2</sub>.
This dataset contains all 565 DFT optimized IrO<sub>x</sub> polymorphs.
