\begin{abstract}

% ################################# Paragraph #################################
Recent advacnemnets in statistial methods, colloquially termed as machine learning,
have revolutionized a tremendous number of fields due to the ease by which we can train models that are flexible enough to regress to data of interest while mainting predictive power.
Nowhere has this this impact been felt as much as in the field of materials science,
which had previously been bottlenecked by reltively computaitnally expensive methods.

Herein, we will fill in the abstract and it will be fairly concise but descriptive as well.
Talk about ML, materials screening, OER, and Ir systems.

% ################################# Paragraph #################################
Iterative Active Machine Learning and unique prototype identification to discover stable new materials and catalysts.
Motivation for \ce{IrO_x}, low representation, longstanding controversy over oxidation states and topology, and demonstrates promise for OER and Li ion batteries.

Reported +6 oxidation state phases are achievable leading to high degree of structural variability, which is the highest for transition metals.
High oxidation states (low pH high anodic voltage, harsh oxidizing conditions) unexplored, need very specific structures with precise oxygen connectivity (aka high pressure \ce{SrIrO_3}) that can exist.
Machine learning is the efficient way to explore this “exploring antarctica for life” sparse space.
What we show here...

% AB2 Structures Ankit
- There are XYZ unique AB2 structures (or multiples, e.g. A2B4)
- Of those we found 697 unique AB2 prototypes (unique SG/Wyckoff combination) in OQMD/MP
- To generate our test set we substituted Ir for A and O for B, then isotropically expanded cell volume to constrain a minimum Ir-O distance of XYZ
- Next translated each of the 697 structures to be described by 271 features (invariant to isotropic expansion/compression), then reduced to 30 using PCA, described in methods XYZ
- To generate initial training data use existing DFT. Not enough on \ce{IrO_2}, so used OQMD to generate initial training data from nearest structures in phase space, described in Methods XYZ. Training set of 30 structures in SI XYZ.

% ################################# Paragraph #################################
% Iterative Training of Gaussian Process
- Trained Gaussian Process, rational quadratic kernel, variable lengthscales.
CV error of XYZ ev/atom, initial predictions in figure XYZ.
- Selected 10 structures with lowest prediction-uncertainty for DFT.
Structures were volume optimized, then fully relaxed, described in methods XYZ.
- Model retrained with the 10 DFT computed structures ONLY, 271 features->110 features applicable to \ce{IrO_2}->20 principle components for 99.9 percent variance.
CV error…
- Repeat until XYZ, final predictions shown in Fig XYZ

% Get VASP #reference in the ex. word doc. that @Michal shared with me
All OER calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) implemented via the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) and utilizing the PBE exchange-correlation functiional.
Dipole corrections were imposed on all non-symmetric slabs.
A 4x4x3 k-point mesh with gamma-point cenntered Monkshort-packing was used for all slabs.
The plane-wave energy cutoff was 500 eV.

% COMBAK Figure out how much spacing was used for all slabs
% FIXME Change the A -> Angstrom symbol

% COMBAK What kind of optimization routine was used? (Newtonian, BFGS?)
All slab calculations maintained a vacuum spacing of <15 A.
% COMBAK change A -> Angstrom
All structures were relaxed utilizing a TEMP algorithm with a stop criteria being that all atoms satify a maximum force threshold of 0.02 eV/A.

Procedure:
  - For the top/most stable bulk structures the following procedure was carried out

  * Stable stoicheometric terminations were cut from the bulk
      Stable termination planes were guesstimated via intution, and the x-ray diffraction pattern tool from Vesta

  * Electrochemical surface coverage was elucidated via a surface Pourbiax analysis
      Need to know the coverage of surface under operating conditions (>1.23 VRHE)

  * Thermodynamic/limiting potential analysis of the OER mechanistic pathway
      Volcano plot, limiting potentials, etc.
